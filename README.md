# Festival

We plan to convene a Beijing venue of the Global Computational Law Festival at Tsinghua Law School in the month of March, 2019.  We plan for this page to serve as the international coordination point to share information and activities with our collaborators at MIT and Brooklyn Law School.  

Let's see what will happen!
